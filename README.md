# storm
Tropical Storms are given distinct names to make it easier to keep track of them. No two storms are given the same name. Often, they travel in paths that cross numerous cities before dissipating. Each storm can be described by the cities it hits and the year in which it occurred. A single city can be hit by more than one tropical storm in the same year or over many years.
